<p>The massive growth in digital adoption in Pakistan has caught the marketers by surprise. Brands are looking to catch up with the consumers in digital age but are neither prepared nor committed to master this beast. With the highest reach amongst all media, it is shocking to realize that only 1-2% of the total marketing spent of an organization goes to digital.</p><p>Brands are not the only culprits here. With the boom in digital media the mushroom growth in digital agencies has hurt the growth of this industry the most. The agencies have duped the brands into measuring the success of their digital media campaigns through <strong>vanity metrics</strong>– Metrics that are good to feel awesome but have no actionable value. Some of the most prevalent vanity metrics include:</p><ol><li>Number of the visitors on the website</li><li>Average time spent on the website</li><li>Number of fans on the fanpage</li><li>Number of likes/comments on the fanpage</li><li>Most engaging content</li><li>Number of newsletter/sms subscribers</li></ol><p>The reliance on <strong>vanity metrics</strong> is because of two major reasons. Firstly, these are easy to measure especially through automated tools and built in analytics in most digital platforms. Companies like social bakers rank the social media efforts of all brands on these vanity metrics giving a perception that this is the globally accepted way of measuring your success or failure on social media. Secondly, they are easy to achieve through various legitimate and illegitimate ways. However, none of these metrics will bring product innovation, increase your sales or differentiate your brand from your competitors.</p><p>Using digital for your advantage takes more than the metrics. It needs a more human approach to analyzing your digital efforts by asking the right questions. Here are some of the key questions you need to answer to get the most of your digital efforts.</p><ol><li><strong>Audience</strong></li></ol><p>Invest your time in learning about your audience through social media interaction. Dig deeper into the demographics of your fan base. If your fan base is primarily from your target group, learn about their interests. Facebook ads panel is a great way to learn about the interest of your fans, even if you don’t use it for ad placement.</p><p>If the majority of your audience is not from your target audience, invest time in learning the reasons behind it. Ask the difficult questions, demand to see the ads your agency used to build the fan base or bring traffic to your website and see how each ad performed in each demographic segment. Don’t see how often your audience is engaging with your brand but see how they are engaging with it. Are they showing interest in your brand and your offering or are they there to win a contest. You might have used wrong messages and targeting to attract your audience.</p><p>Alternatively, keep an open mind about your brand. It might be possible that if you are seeing a different audience on your digital assets than you intended, a different segment of population is genuinely interested in your brand. Can you target this audience with a customized offering? Do you need to reposition your brand?</p><ol><li><strong>Product Ideas</strong></li></ol><p>If you sift through the comments on the fanpages for most of the largest brands in Pakistan, you will be amazed to see the wealth of consumer generated ideas for service improvement, product innovations, product extensions and market expansion. Very often you will see people sharing their experience of using your product in an innovative way. Mostly, the ideas will come in the form of complains. Maybe your order delivery process is too cumbersome, your packaging needs improvement, your product is missing a key feature. Whatever it is, be sure that your customers will be complaining about it online. Take a step back, do not rush to delete the user complaint, note it down and act on it!</p><ol><li><strong>Competitors</strong></li></ol><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, like you the chances are that your biggest competitor has an ignored digital media platform as well. Frequent the digital media channels of your competitors and see what the customers are saying about them. What do they love in their product/service and what do they abhor. Can you position yourself to address the pain point your competitor is missing out on? Can you improve on the areas for which the customers are choosing your competitor and not you. All this information is right in front of you, all you need is to LISTEN.</p><ol><li><strong>Complaints</strong></li></ol><p>I have seen brand managers turn all shades of red going through customer complaints on social media platforms. The usual conversation with a brand manager exploring social media for the first time goes like this “HE IS BAD MOUTHING US ON OUR CHANNEL, AM I PAYING YOU FOR THIS??” Mmm..Welcome to the real world Mr. Brand Manager.</p><p>If there is a problem with your product/service your pricing or your customer care be sure to read it on social media. Never delete a criticism from your social media channel unless it is abusive. Use that criticism to find out what people really think about your brand and the areas you can improve upon. In addition a customer’s complain on social media is a great chance to build your brand. Instead of deleting the comments, if you address the complain on priority the same customer is likely to come back to your page and appreciate your effort. This will show your other customers that you are a brand that care. Build your brand by addressing complains.</p><ol><li><strong>Content</strong></li></ol><p>So last month you shared the cricket related meme on your fan page that you probably copied from an amateur artist. Guess what , it was your most viral content. The fans loved it, there were hundreds of comments and likes, and there were some shares too. You are itching to get another one of those “viral contents” on your page…stop! How did that build your brand? How did it engage users with your brand? Did it affect the audience’s intent to purchase?</p><p>When analyzing the content that works for you, look deeper than these vanity metrics. Look at the engagement magnitude of the content relevant to your brand. Maybe your audience is responding well to the memes, instead of focusing on cricket memes, will it be a good idea to build your own brand memes? Think.</p><ol><li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></li></ol><p>A lot of fancy reports you receive from your agencies might include this section. A sentiment analysis is a measure of people talking positively, negatively and neutrally about your brand. Many agencies are providing these metrics to show you how your brand is being talked about on social media. Conceptually, it’s a great metric to gauge your brand health. However, practically in the local market this unfortunately fails to deliver any true representation of conversation around your brand. Every sentiment analysis tool has been built internationally and caters to international languages. A sizeable part of our population communicates in roman especially on social media. These automated tools fail to recognize this prevalent communication method and thus incorrectly categorizes the brand conversations giving an inaccurate account of your brand sentiments.</p><p>Do not accept these automated reports to represent your brand. Ask your agency to monitor and record every conversation around your brand, categorize it and then show you the result. Make sure you can drill down on each category to monitor the conversations yourself.</p><ol><li><strong>Budget</strong></li></ol><p>Do not waste your budget on digital.</p><p>If you are not getting the competitive advantage from digital all you are doing is wasting your money. If you expect your agency to do all the above for you in the meager sum you pay under the head of “social media management” you are sadly mistaken. The people working on your account will be working on 5 other accounts and unless you are financially and strategically involved in your digital media presence your agency won’t be either. Get a dedicated team for your brand, whose only job is to monitor and analyze the digital data from your brand. Talk to your agency on the actual cost of building that team. If you really want to use the digital mediums make a financial as well as strategic commitment to these mediums.</p><p>*This post first appeared at <a href="http://www.mediapoondi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mediapoondi.com</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Moving from Vanity Metrics to Strategic Insights</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
